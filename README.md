# Introduction 
This repo includes the Terraform templates for Azure resource deployment. They can be easily deployed via CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps. 

The deployment includes the creation of:
- Resource Group (where all the following resources will be stored in)
- Virtual Network (including subnets)
- Application Insights 
- Key Vault 
- Storage Account 
- Machine Learning Workspace 

# Getting Started and Test it Yourself
You will need an Azure subscription and access to Azure DevOps to complete this deployment. 

I have recorded a step by step tutorial to guide you through (link will be uploaded soon).
